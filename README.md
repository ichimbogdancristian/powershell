# PowerShell Enhanced Profile

An advanced, cross-version PowerShell enhancement suite providing a Linux-like experience, productivity tools, and a beautiful prompt for both Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell Core 7+. Designed for seamless, automated setup and robust user experience on Windows.


## üöÄ Quick Start

Recommended (run the interactive installer):

```batch
quick-setup.bat
```

Local install (if repo is cloned):

```powershell
# Clean install (removes all profile contents, no backups)
./quick-install.ps1 -CleanInstall

# Preserve existing configs
./quick-install.ps1
```


## üîß Installer behavior & logs

- Option 1 in the `quick-setup.bat` profile menu now immediately begins installation (after a brief "Press any key to begin" pause). This ensures the installer runs and prints logs even when launched by double-click.
- The installer writes a timestamped logfile to your temporary folder. Example logfile path:

```
%TEMP%\powershell-install-<yyyyMMdd_HHmmss>.log
```

- The logfile contains the full transcript (tool checks, download, extraction, copy/xcopy output, and final status). If the console window closes unexpectedly, inspect the most recent logfile to see what happened.

View the latest logfile in PowerShell:

```powershell
# show last 200 lines of most recent install log
Get-ChildItem $env:TEMP -Filter 'powershell-install-*.log' | Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending | Select-Object -First 1 | Get-Content -Tail 200
```


## ‚ú® Key Features

- Linux-like aliases: `ll`, `la`, `grep`, `find`, `top`, `df`, `free`, etc.
- System monitoring: `neofetch`, `health` commands with real-time stats
- Git integration: Enhanced git status and branch info
- Oh My Posh themes: Custom, beautiful prompt with platform, git, and system info
- Enhanced file operations: Smart `ls` with icons, colors, and details
- Cross-platform: Installs for both PowerShell 5.1 and 7+ automatically
- Smart installation: Clean install option, automatic backups, cross-version support


## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- **OS**: Windows 10/11 (or Server 2019/2022)
- **PowerShell**: 5.1 and/or 7+
- **Internet**: Required for first-time setup


## üì¶ What Gets Installed

1. **PowerShell Modules**: PSReadLine, posh-git, Terminal-Icons (from Gallery or bundled)
2. **Tools**: Oh My Posh, Git, Zoxide (via winget)
3. **Profile**: Unified, robust PowerShell profile with aliases, prompt, and helpers
4. **Theme**: Custom Oh My Posh theme (`oh-my-posh-default.json`)

Profile Locations:
- PowerShell Core: `Documents\\PowerShell\\`
- Windows PowerShell: `Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\`


## üèÅ Example Commands

```powershell
neofetch        # System information
ll              # Enhanced directory listing
health          # System health status
help-profile    # Show all available commands
z <dir>         # Smart jump (if zoxide installed)
```


## üß† How It Works

- Detects all installed PowerShell versions and deploys profiles to both
- Cleans profile directories if `-CleanInstall` is used (no backups)
- Installs modules from Gallery or uses bundled versions for reliability
- Installs tools via `winget` if available
- Verifies theme and font setup after install


## üé® Theme Customization

The included `oh-my-posh-default.json` theme provides:
- OS and platform icons
- Smart path and folder icons
- Git status, branch, and change indicators
- Node.js and Python environment detection
- Execution time, clock, and admin status

To use a different theme:

```powershell
# List available themes
Get-PoshThemes

# Set a different theme temporarily
oh-my-posh init pwsh --config "$env:POSH_THEMES_PATH\\[theme-name].omp.json" | Invoke-Expression
# To make permanent, edit the profile or replace oh-my-posh-default.json
```


## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

**Installer created a logfile but the console closed:**
1. Find the most recent logfile in `%TEMP%` named `powershell-install-*.log` (see command above).
2. Inspect the log for errors (download/extract/copy failures will be present).

**Theme not loading:**
1. Ensure Oh My Posh is installed: `winget install JanDeDobbeleer.OhMyPosh`
2. Check if theme file exists in your PowerShell directory
3. Restart PowerShell after installation

**Icons not displaying:**
1. Install a Nerd Font (e.g., FiraCode Nerd Font)
2. Set your terminal font to the Nerd Font

**Profile not loading:**
1. Run the installer again
2. Check execution policy: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
3. Restart PowerShell

**Module errors:**
1. Update PowerShell: `winget upgrade Microsoft.PowerShell`
2. Update modules: `Update-Module -Name PSReadLine,posh-git,Terminal-Icons`

**Performance issues:**
- The profile is optimized for fast loading
- Disable animations: `$env:POSH_DISABLE_ANIMATIONS = $true`
